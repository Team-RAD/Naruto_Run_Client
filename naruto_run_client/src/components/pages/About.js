			<p className='lead'>
				Naruto Run helps to speed up the process of identifying which area of
				the tech world people want to work in and the best road to run down to
				get there. It does this by providing a hub for the posting of tech
				career journeys by users already in the industry (contributors) for the
				reference of other users (seekers) wanting to make the move into tech.
				It allows contributors to outline their path into a tech career in a
				condensed, efficient form, so that seekers can quickly distill this
				information and that of other NR posts into a clearer picture of where
				they should focus their efforts.
