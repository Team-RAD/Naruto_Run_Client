				<p className='lead'>
					Technology is a massive industry with many pathways of entry and
					career directions to take. Itâ€™s often daunting for new tech hopefuls
					to get started on their journey and this can be made harder by
					uncertainty with how best to proceed due to seemingly limitless
					opinions online.

					The <span className='text-warning'>Solution</span>
				</h2>
				<p className='lead'>
					Naruto Run helps to speed up the process of identifying which area of
					the tech world people want to work in and the best road to run down to
					get there. It does this by providing a hub for the posting of tech
					career journeys by users already in the industry (contributors) for
					the reference of other users (seekers) wanting to make the move into
					tech. It allows contributors to outline their path into a tech career
					in a condensed, efficient form, so that seekers can quickly distill
					this information and that of other NR posts into a clearer picture of
					where they should focus their efforts.
