#### Team Structure

The RAD team met up prior to project commencement to bond, clarify objectives and assign roles to better aid in our development process, thus maximizing our chances of a successful build.

Roles were assigned as follows:

- Ryan: RAD team leader and client-side lead
- Adam: Testing lead, database manager as well as utility between front-end and back-end build
- Dave: Concept design and server-side lead

We also decided our team would work together literally not just figuratively so we set up our HQ at Ryan’s house and spent every day of this project physically working side-by-side (keeping covid-safe of course).

Although the RAD team worked synergistically to complete the build of our application (which included lots of team-based programming, research, problem solving, and crossovers into each other’s arenas) we all had our specific duties we were ultimately responsible for. This ensured every key aspect of Naruto Run’s design, implementation, and testing had a specific member of the RAD team responsible for its success.

- Ryan's total contribution to the Naruto Run project: 33%
- Adam's total contribution to the Naruto Run project: 33%
- Dave's total contribution to the Naruto Run project: 33%
- 1% goes to Ryan's dogs Franklin and Cammy, without whom none of this would be possible.

#### Tech Stack:

- MongoDB for data storage
- ExpressJS for web server
- ReactJS for client UI
- NodeJS for server runtime
- Bootstrap4 for UI styling
- Mongoose for server middleware
- Netlify for front-end hosting
- Heroku for back-end hosting
- Git for source control

#### Client-Side Libraries:

- Axios: HTTP library for providing data to the browser via Node.js, utilises JS ES6 promises to achieve this
- Classnames: Utility for chaining classNames together in JSX for UI improvements/aesthetics.
- Bootstrap4: UI toolkit, featuring CSS components, responsive CSS grid layout, and JS plugins for component behaviours
- React-Router-DOM: provides DOM bindings for React Router to serve up components on specified routes
